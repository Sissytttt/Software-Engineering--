City Connect APP

0. Introduction to the project
CityConnection is a platform to transform the way individuals experience and engage with their cities. The project aims to create a comprehensive Social Engagement and Memories Platform that empowers users to engage and interact with urban activities and services and memorize the activities they like in the app by marking and favoring the events. The project also provides the business owner end for event holders and business owners to publish events, start their business, and get access to the citizens. Through these applications, we provide the platform that connects business owners and citizens through the city's places and constructions, transforming the way people engage with the city.
